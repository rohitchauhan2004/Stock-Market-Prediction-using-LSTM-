🚀 Project Overview
This project leverages an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict Tata Motors stock prices using historical data. The model is trained on over a decade of stock data to forecast future trends with high accuracy.

📌 Key Features
📊 Data Collection

Used yfinance to collect 10+ years of historical stock data for Tata Motors.

🧠 LSTM Model Development

Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.

Improved RMSE and MAPE compared to baseline models (e.g., ARIMA, Linear Regression).

📉 Visualization

Plotted actual vs. predicted prices using Matplotlib to analyze forecast accuracy and trends.

🔁 Real-Time Prediction Automation

Automated live prediction pipeline using scheduled data pulls and model inference.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Pandas, NumPy

scikit-learn

yfinance

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Git

🧠 Results & Evaluation
Achieved better Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) than traditional models.

Forecasts aligned closely with real market behavior during test periods
